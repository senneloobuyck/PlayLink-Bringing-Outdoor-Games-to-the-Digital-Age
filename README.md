# PlayLink-Bringing Outdoor Games to the Digital Age

## 🧑‍💻 My Role

I was one of the **frontend developers** on this project. My responsibilities focused on building interactive and user-friendly interfaces for both gameplay and game creation.

### 🚀 Core frontend technologies used:
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **React-Leaflet** (for interactive, location-based maps)
- Modern component-based frontend architecture

This role gave me hands-on experience with **real-time map interactions, state management, and user-driven interfaces** in a complex, collaborative web application.
