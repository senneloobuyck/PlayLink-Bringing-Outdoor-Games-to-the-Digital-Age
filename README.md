# PlayLink -- Bringing Outdoor Games to the Digital Age

## 🌱 Why This Project?

This project was developed as part of the **Design Project** course and was driven by the goal of **encouraging people to go outside and be more physically active**. With increasing smartphone usage and declining outdoor play, especially among young people, we wanted to explore how technology could be used to promote healthier and more active lifestyles instead of replacing them.

Our main focus was on **youth movements**, where outdoor games play an important social and physical role. To support this, we built not only an outdoor game application, but also a **developer platform** that allows users to easily create and customize their own games. By providing a flexible, low-threshold game creation environment, we aimed to empower youth leaders and organizations to design engaging outdoor experiences tailored to their own groups.


## 🧑‍💻 My Role

I was one of the **frontend developers** on this project. My responsibilities focused on building interactive and user-friendly interfaces for both gameplay and game creation.

### 🚀 Core frontend technologies used:
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **React-Leaflet** (for interactive, location-based maps)
- Modern component-based frontend architecture

This role gave me hands-on experience with **real-time map interactions, state management, and user-driven interfaces** in a complex, collaborative web application.
